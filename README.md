## 🔍 About Me

Over the past three years, I’ve worked across diverse teams and industries — earning trust, building value, and helping turn bold ideas into real-world outcomes. I thrive at the intersection of **strategy, product, and technology**, and I’m passionate about turning complexity into clarity.

Currently, I’m on a mission to build an **AI-native startup in Bangladesh**, focused on creating localized solutions that blend behavioral economics, finance, and AI. With a background in business operations and a degree in Film & Media Studies, I bring a **multidisciplinary approach** to solving problems and scaling innovation.

In previous roles, I’ve supported **project coordination**, **business development**, and **data-driven strategy** across remote teams and PMO-style agencies.
